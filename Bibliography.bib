abstract="The inorganic terrigenous fraction of marine sediments offers a great number of different and well established proxy parameters to investigate the development of Earth's climate. This study presents a synthesis of multidisciplinary investigations which have been applied to late Quaternary sediments recovered from the low-latitude Atlantic during the Bremen Special Reseach Project 261. In the equatorial Atlantic terrigenous matter is supplied by eolian and fluvial pathways. In addition to the dust input from African deserts, the catchment areas of the three major rivers Amazon, Niger and Zaire (Congo) are the dominant sources. Small river systems are of local importance. Terrigenous records from near-continental and open pelagic depositional settings are discussed. The main questions we focused on are a) the control of climate change and b) the identification and timing of rapidly occurring events. Results from the low-latitude Atlantic support the suggestion that both high-latitude and low-latitude forcing influence tropical climate and marine sedimentation. Apparently, the frequency of climate variability in the tropics during the late Quaternary is controlled by the precessional insolation cycle, whereas amplitudes and timing of climate change are mainly determined by the high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Within the phase relationships, however, regional differences arise. Furthermore, there is evidence for climate instability during glacials and interglacials which probably occurred on decadal to centennial time scales.",

abstract = "Environmental archives, such as sediments, banded corals and tree rings, are widely used to reconstruct past environmental conditions of ecosystems. In particular, 210Pb has been used during more than 4 decades, through dating of undisturbed sediment cores, to study ecosystem changes during the last 100yr. Since its inception, diverse dating models have been proposed, developed, used and validated in numerous environments, but their nomenclature and formulation is not homogenous. In this work we emphasize that conceptual models used to date undisturbed sediment cores can be deduced from a single fundamental equation, which relates excess 210Pb concentration in sediment, its flux to the sediment surface and mass accumulation rate. From this equation, models were consistently named based on the main hypothesis used and, using a unified and logical nomenclature, dating equations were derived in detail. We applied in detail most of the described models to a sediment core from Mexico and uncertainty expressions were also included. Finally, some recommendations to use the models are proposed. We believe that this work can facilitate the use of 210Pb as a tool to date sediment cores in a more homogeneous way."

In this paper an XRF method is tested by measuring a wide range of environmental materials of known elemental composition. Precision, accuracy and detection limits are presented.",
